# Argonaut Project

The Argonaut Project's security workgroup is supporting the development of open
specifications for end-user authorization of clinical apps, and single-sign-on
into clinical apps. To accomplish these goals, Argonaut is working with the
[SMART Platforms team](http://smartplatforms.org) at Boston Children's Hospital
to produce specifications that serve four key use cases:

 * Clinicians running web-based apps against EHR data
 * Clinicians running mobile apps against EHR data
 * Patients running web-absed apps against a patient portal account
 * Patients running mobile apps against a portal account

# Specs and References

Our specs build on two key open standards:
[OAuth 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID
Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).
