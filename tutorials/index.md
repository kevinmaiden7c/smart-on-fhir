# Tutorials - Overview

[Building a JavaScript App]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/javascript/)

The SMART on FHIR JavaScript client library helps you build browser-based SMART apps that interact with a FHIR REST API server. It can help your app get authorization tokens, provide information about the user and patient record in context, and issue API calls to fetch clinical data.

[Testing Your SMART App Against The Public Sandbox] ({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/testing/)

This tutorial will walk you through the steps for testing your SMART on mFHIR app against our public apps container.

[Simple Authorization App]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/authorization/)

This tutorial will demonstrate the basic implementation steps to perform SMART on FHIR OAuth2 authorization and retrieve patient data from scratch without relying on a specialized SMART on FHIR client. Understanding the implementation steps of this mechanism is useful if you are planning on developing your own SMART on FHIR client or would simply like to gain insight into the SMART on FHIR authorization protocol. If you would rather start with writing SMART on FHIR apps as quickly as possible, you can use our Java Script client which handles the authorization process for you (see this tutorial to learn about the JS client)

[Quick-start: Making your EHR SMART]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/server-quick-start/)

This is a getting-started guide for Health IT systems looking to support pluggable apps using SMART on FHIR. We'll take you through the process of allowing your users to launch a single app: the open-source SMART Growth Charts app.
