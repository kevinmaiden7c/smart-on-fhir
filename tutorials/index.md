# Tutorials - Overview

### [Building a JavaScript App]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/javascript/)

The SMART on FHIR JavaScript client library helps you build browser-based SMART apps that 
interact with a FHIR REST API server. It can help your app get authorization tokens, provide 
information about the user and patient record in context, and issue API calls to fetch 
clinical data. This tutorial will lead you through the basics of building a SMART app using 
the JavaScript client.


### [Testing Your SMART App Against The Public Sandbox]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/testing/)

This tutorial will walk you through the steps for testing your SMART app 
against our public apps container from your local machine.

### [Simple Authorization App]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/authorization/)

This tutorial will demonstrate the basic implementation steps to perform SMART on FHIR OAuth2 authorization and retrieve patient data from scratch without relying on a specialized SMART on FHIR client. Understanding the implementation steps of this mechanism is useful if you are planning on developing your own SMART on FHIR client or would simply like to gain insight into the SMART on FHIR authorization protocol. If you would rather start with writing SMART on FHIR apps as quickly as possible, you can use our client libraries which handle the authorization process for you.
