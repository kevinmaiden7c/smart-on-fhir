# Quick-start: Building a SMART on FHIR server

This is a getting-started guide for SMART on FHIR server developers. It focused
on getting a single app running: the open-source SMART Growth Charts app.   

To run the Growth Charts app against your own SMART on FHIR server, you'll need
to:

1. Expose clinical data using FHIR `Patient` and `Observation` resources
2. Protect your clinical data via the [SMART on FHIR Authorization protocols](http://docs.smartplatforms.org/authorization/public) (based on OAuth2).

To get up and running as easily as possible, this quick-start guide helps you
through two scenarios: first, to run the app in debugging mode against an
unprotected server, and second, to get the app running against an
OAuth2-protected server.

## Debugging: Launch Growth Charts against your unprotected server

Once you've exposed the necessary clinical data (see payload examples below for
full details), you can launch the Growth Charts app in debugging mode (no
authorization required) by supplying two URL parameters:

[https://fhir.smartplatforms.org/apps/growth-chart/launch.html?](https://fhir.smartplatforms.org/apps/growth-chart/launch.html?fhirServiceUrl=https://fhir-open-api.smartplatforms.org&patientId=1482713)

 * `fhirServiceUrl={FHIR base URL of your unprotected server}`
 * `patientId={patient ID from your server}`

## For real: Launch Growth Charts against your OAuth2-protected server

Once you've implemented the [SMART on FHIR Authorization
protocols](http://docs.smartplatforms.org/authorization/public), you can launch
the app in production mode (with authorization) by completing the following
sequence:

#### 1. Create a launch context

On your back-end, create a SMART "launch context" that includes a patient ID
and any other context details you want to track. You'll assign a "launch id" to
this context, which you'll pass to the Growth Charts app as a URL parameter. In
the real world, you'd create a launch context every time a user launches an app
 -- though for prototyping, you might just want to create a trivial implementation
that hard-codes whatever values you care about.

#### 2. Open the app

Create a new browser window with the following URL:

[https://fhir.smartplatforms.org/apps/growth-chart/launch.html?](https://fhir.smartplatforms.org/apps/growth-chart/launch.html?iss=https://fhir-open-api.smartplatforms.org&launch=23)

 * `iss={FHIR base URL of your OAuth2-protected server}`
 * `launch={opaque launch ID generated by your server}`

## Data requirements

When the SMART Growth Charts, it will fetch:

### 1. Patient demographics
```
curl 'https://fhir-open-api.smartplatforms.org/Patient/1482713' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### 2. All Weight, Height, Head Circumference, and BMI Observations
Note LOINC Codes: `3141-9`, `8302-2`, `8287-5`, `39156-5`

```
curl 'https://fhir-open-api.smartplatforms.org/Observation?subject%3APatient=1482713&name=3141-9%2C8302-2%2C8287-5%2C39156-5&_count=50' -H 'Accept: application/json' 
```
