# Tutorials - Quick-start: Making your EHR SMART

This is a getting-started guide for Health IT systems looking to support pluggable
apps using SMART on FHIR. We'll take you through the process of allowing your users to launch
a single app: the open-source SMART Growth Charts app.   

To get Growth Charts running inside your EHR, you'll implement a basic SMART on FHIR server that can:

1. Expose clinical data using FHIR `Patient` and `Observation` resources
2. Protect your clinical data via the [SMART on FHIR App Authorization protocol](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/) (based on OAuth2).
3. Allow a user to launch Growth Charts by clicking a "launch" button

To get up and running as easily as possible, this quick-start guide helps you
through two scenarios: first, to run the app in debugging mode against an
unprotected server, and second, to get the app running against an
OAuth2-protected server.

## Debugging: Launch Growth Charts against your unprotected server

Once you've exposed the necessary clinical data (see payload examples below for
full details), make sure that you're exposing Cross-Origin Request Support (CORS) headers
with your HTTP responses. A quick set of headers to get starter would be:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: origin, authorization, accept, content-type, x-requested-with
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

At this point, you can launch the Growth Charts app in debugging mode (no
authorization required).

You'll expose a "launch" button that users can click from within an existing EHR session.  When a user clicks this button, you'll load the following URL in a new browser window (or an iframe, or an embedded browser widget, depending on the architecture of your EHR), supplying two URL parameters:

[http://examples.smarthealthit.org/growth-chart-app/launch.html?fhirServiceUrl=https://r2.smarthealthit.org&patientId=smart-1482713](http://examples.smarthealthit.org/growth-chart-app/launch.html?fhirServiceUrl=https://r2.smarthealthit.org&patientId=smart-1482713)

 * `fhirServiceUrl={FHIR base URL of your unprotected server}`
 * `patientId={patient ID from the current user session}`

You can click the URL above for a live example (running against our open testing server).

## For real: Launch Growth Charts against your OAuth2-protected server

Once you've implemented the [SMART on FHIR Authorization
protocols](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization), you can wire up your "launch" button to launch
the app in production mode (with authorization) by completing the following
sequence:

#### 1. Create a launch context

On your back-end, as soon as a user clicks the launch button you'll create a SMART "launch context" that includes (at least) the patient ID from the current EHR user session.  You'll assign a new "launch id" to
this context, and you'll pass that id to the Growth Charts app as a URL parameter. In
the real world, you'd create a launch context every time a user launches an app
 -- though for prototyping, you might just want to create a trivial implementation
that hard-codes a set of sample values.

#### 2. Open the app

When a user launches the Growth Charts app from inside your EHR, you'll load the following URL in a new browser window (or an iframe, or an embedded browser widget, depending on the architecture of your EHR), supplying two URL parameters:

[http://examples.smarthealthit.org/growth-chart-app/launch.html?](#)

 * `iss={FHIR base URL of your OAuth2-protected server}`
 * `launch={opaque launch ID generated by your server}`

(Note: the link above is for example purposes only. You'll need to fill in your
own server's issuer and a launch ID to proceed.)

## Data requirements

When the SMART Growth Charts, it will fetch:

### 1. Patient demographics
```sh
curl 'https://r2.smarthealthit.org/Patient/smart-1482713' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### 2. All Weight, Height, Head Circumference, and BMI Observations
Note LOINC Codes: `3141-9`, `8302-2`, `8287-5`, `39156-5`

```sh
curl 'https://r2.smarthealthit.org/Observation?subject%3APatient=smart-1482713&code=3141-9%2C8302-2%2C8287-5%2C39156-5&_count=50' -H 'Accept: application/json' 
```
