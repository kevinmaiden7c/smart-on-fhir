# SMART Sandbox

The SMART Health IT Sandbox is a virtual testing environment that mimics a live EHR production environment, but is populated with sample data. Use it to test and demonstrate apps for practitioners and patients that use the SMART on FHIR platform to access clinical data.

The Sandbox is provided by the SMART Health IT project as a free service to the healthcare app development community and is for testing purposes only. Do not store any information that contains personal health information or any other confidential information. This system should not be used in the provision of clinical care.

## Online Sandbox

You can access the sandbox at [https://launch.smarthealthit.org](https://launch.smarthealthit.org) to launch SMART apps. Unlike earlier versions of the sandbox, no registration is required.

The sandbox's open **DSTU2 FHIR server** is accessible directly at [https://r2.smarthealthit.org/](https://r2.smarthealthit.org). Note that the data in the online sandbox is reset on a nightly basis. [Click Here](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/data/dstu2-sandbox-data) for more information about the data available in the DSTU2 Sandbox.

The sandbox's open **STU3 FHIR server** is accessible directly at [https://r3.smarthealthit.org/](https://r3.smarthealthit.org). Note that the data in the online sandbox is reset on a nightly basis. [Click Here](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/data/stu3-sandbox-data) for more information about the data available in the STU3 Sandbox.

The sandbox's open **R4 FHIR server** is accessible directly at [https://r4.smarthealthit.org/](https://r4.smarthealthit.org). Note that the data in the online sandbox is reset on a nightly basis. It contains data for more than 600 patients.

## Self-Hosted Sandbox

If you're an advanced user, you can set up a local copy of the sandbox on your computer using Docker. The open source code to do this is available at https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-dev-sandbox.
