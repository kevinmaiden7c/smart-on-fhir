# Sandbox - Overview

The public demo sandbox for SMART on FHIR is useful to demonstrate
the platform in action and to test apps against patient data
in development or as a showcase. The main components of the sandbox
are:

* [Sample Apps Server](https://fhir.smartplatforms.org)
* [API Server](https://fhir-api.smartplatforms.org)
* [Authorization Server](https://authorize.smartplatforms.org)

The best place to start if you are new to SMART on FHIR is by visiting
the [Sample Apps Server](https://fhir.smartplatforms.org), but before you
do this, you should [create an account]({{site.baseurl}}sandbox/account)
for yourself on the system.
