# Sandbox Persona 

## Introduction
A sandbox persona is a user used for authenticating when launching an app. A Persona is tied to either a Practitioner or Patient FHIR Resource. 


### Step 1: Select who the Persona (patient or practitioner) will be

A Persona is used to simulate a real-world actor in an app launch. First, select either patient or practitioner.  
* If you select a practitioner, then you are creating a Persona which is tied to a practitioner to later be used to open an app and perform a function.
* If you select a patient, then you are creating a Persona which is tied to a patient to later be used to log into a PHR or patient portal to perform a function.

### Step 2: Enter a user id and password for the Persona

Enter a user id and password to be used when authenticating the persona during the app launch. 

### Step 3: Save

Save the Persona. Now the Persona is available to be used in a [Launch Scenario](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/sandbox/launch.html) or for authentication during a standalone launch.
