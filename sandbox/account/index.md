# Sandbox - Account Setup

You can register a new account for our public sandbox or manage
your existing account by visiting our [account self-service](https://service.smarthealthit.org)
tool. Once you have an account in our system, you will be able to use our authorization service
and [register new apps]({{site.baseurl}}sandbox/register) on it.
