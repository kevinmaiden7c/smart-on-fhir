# Sandbox - Building Your Own Sandbox

The easiest way to build your very own SMART on FHIR setup is to
use our Ansible-based automated installer. The Ansible playbook can be
used with Vagrant to build a VM with the complete stack or
autonomously to build a custom cloud or local deployment.

To get started, follow the instructions in the installer
GitHUB repository:
