# FHIR Bulk Data Proposal

[The Spec on GitHub](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-bulk-data-docs)


## Goals
Healthcare organizations have many reasons for bulk-data export, including, populating a data warehouse for operational or clinical analytics, leveraging population health and decision support tools from external vendor, migrating from one EHR vendor to another, and submitting data to regulatory agencies like CMS. Today, bulk export is often accomplished through proprietary pipelines and every data transfer operation becomes an engineering and mapping project. This specification will sketch out a FHIR-based approach to bulk export.



## Resources
- Ongoing discussion and documentation around this proposal will take place on the wiki and issues sections of the github repository at [https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-bulk-data-docs/issues](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-bulk-data-docs/issues)
