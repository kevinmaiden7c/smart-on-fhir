# Clients - Other Frameworks

## Overview

[The HSPC Java Client library](https://healthservices.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HSPC/HSPC+Java+Client+Library) is a Java library that uses the SMART on FHIR specification to integrate a Java app to an EHR.

A Ruby FHIR Client is also available: https://github.com/fhir-crucible/fhir_client

If you build a FHIR client or know of any other available frameworks, please [contact us](https://smarthealthit.org/an-app-platform-for-healthcare/contact-us/) to add them here!  

If you would like to build your own SMART client, you may want to take a look at our [Simple Authorization App Tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/authorization) for an idea about how to get started.
