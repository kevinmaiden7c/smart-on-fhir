* Core SMART Patients 
  * 67 DSTU2 Core SMART Patients were created using the [SMART Patient Data Generator](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/sample-patients). This tool creates sample patients in DSTU2 format from csv data files. The SMART sample patient records contain a mix of data derived from real de-identified patient records, as well as some synthetic data elements. 
  
  * Resources include: AllergyIntolerance, Binary, Condition, DocumentReference, Encounter, FamilyMemberHistory, Immunization, MedicationDispense, MedicationRequest, Observation, Patient, and Procedure

* **Synthea Synthetic Patients** 
  * The SMART Team generated 1461 Synthetic sample patients in FHIR DSTU2 format using the [MITRE Synthea tool](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/). For each synthetic patient, Synthea data contains a complete medical history, including medications, allergies, medical encounters, and social determinants of health.
